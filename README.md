# Python Image Recognition System

Welcome to the Python Image Recognition System! This is an open-source project that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to recognize and classify images.

## Project Description
This Python Image Recognition System aims to accurately identify and classify images using cutting-edge technologies in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The project's code base is written entirely in Python, employing libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

## Features
- Image Classification: Identify the object present in an image.
- Object Detection: Recognize multiple objects within a single image and draw bounding boxes around them.
- Real-Time Recognition: Classify images in real-time through webcam feed.
